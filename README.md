# SoundBridge

A lightweight application that enables your macOS speaker and microphone to function as audio input and output devices
on Windows. It achieves low-latency UDP transmission using `pyaudio` and `VB-Audio`.

## Why SoundBridge?

As an AirPods Pro enthusiast who frequently switches between macOS and Windows, I found that the Bluetooth experience on
Windows is far from seamless. Since AirPods are optimized for Apple's ecosystem, switching between devices is often
frustrating. This led me to the idea of porting both input and output audio from Windows to macOS, effectively using the
Mac as a speaker and microphone for the Windows machine.

Despite searching extensively, I couldn't find a simple open-source solution. So, I decided to build one myselfâ€”and here
it is!

## Terminology

- **Server**: The device that functions as the physical speaker and microphone (macOS).
- **Client**: The device that uses the server as a speaker and microphone (Windows).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Client** (Windows) requires:
    - `VB-Cable` for audio routing.
    - `pyaudiowpatch` (for WASAPI loopback support).
- **Server** (macOS) requires:
    - `pyaudio`.

### Setup

#### Server (macOS)

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pyaudio
   ```
2. Run the server script:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```

#### Client (Windows)

1. Install `VB-Cable` and set `VB-Cable Output` as the default **microphone**.
    - **Do not** set `VB-Cable Input` as the default speaker.
    - Instead, set another input device that supports WASAPI loopback.
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pyaudiowpatch
   ```
3. Run the client script:
   ```sh
   python client.py
   ```
4. Configure server IP and port in `config.py` if necessary.

## Controls

- **Toggle microphone usage on the client**: Type `m` and press `Enter` in the console (useful for saving AirPods
  battery).
- **Terminate client**: Press `Enter` in the console.
- **Stop the server**: Press `Enter` in the console.

## Notes

- The application assumes that the client's input/output audio devices remain unchanged during streaming. If changed,
  restart the client.
- The server's default input/output devices can be changed at any time (e.g., putting on or removing AirPods).
- When AirPods disconnect from macOS (e.g., due to being too far away), the server may reload the devices even if the
  default input/output devices remain unchanged. This is not a bug, but a result of internal changes in device indexing.
- If the server is restarted, it is better to restart the client as well.

## Known Issues

- **Audio Occasionally Laggy**: The audio may experience occasional choppiness for a few seconds. This is likely caused
  by packet loss when the server side is connected via Wi-Fi. The solution being worked on is to reduce network traffic
  by transmitting more frames in each UDP packet.

## TODO

- Solve known issues.
